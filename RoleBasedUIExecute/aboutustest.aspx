       Why the 3000 most frequently used English words?
When it comes to learning English, vocabulary is probably the most important thing. Without words, you cannot read, hear, speak, or write. However, have you ever asked yourself:

“How many words do I need to learn to become fluent in English?”

Let's take a look at the dictionary, you will find that there are about 470,000 different words in English. If you learn 20 words a day, it will take you...60 years to learn them all!

OMG!


Fortunately, you don't have to learn them all to become fluent in English. Americans use around 2500 – 3000 of the most common words in their daily lives. If you know these 3000 most common words, you can understand at least 95% of all conversations, e-mails, newspapers, and books.

Sounds great! But what is the most effective way to learn these words?

Focus on example sentences when learning vocabulary. Here's why?
When it comes to learning English vocabulary, the most important thing you need to focus on are example sentences because they help you to improve all your English skills - including vocabulary, listening, speaking, and writing.

Vocabulary: Example sentences help you understand the meaning of the word correctly, and remember it deeply. Why? Because you see the word in context.
Speaking/Writing: You will learn how to use a word in sentences — how to connect it with other words to produce correct English sentences. For each sentence you hear or read, you will be able to re-use it (or part of it) to produce your own correct sentence.
Grammar: You learn English grammar naturally. You don’t have to think about grammar rules to produce a sentence.  Phrases and sentences just appear naturally in your mind and they are all correct. You “feel" grammar, just like a native English speaker.
If you want to speak English fluently, learn with your ears, not with your eyes
Learning English can be broken down into two parts: input and output.  Input consists of reading and listening while output consists of writing and speaking. The more input you get, the more output you can produce. It's that simple.

Here's the little secret you probably don't know yet:

If you want to write English well, focus on reading. The more you read, the better you write.
If you want to speak English well, focus on listening. Listening is THE KEY to speaking excellent English
